My name is Prashanth Guntal, currently student at [University College Dublin,Ireland](https://www.ucd.ie) pursing my master's in Data and Computational Science, having previously worked as **Automation Engineer** in the IT department at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html), in India.

I graduated from [PESIT](https://www.pes.edu) with First Class Honours in ***Information Science*** back in 2016. Will be post graduate from [University College Dublin,Ireland](https://www.ucd.ie) by end of July 2019.

While studying to obtain this specialist academic qualification, combined subsequently with two year's of IT experience, I have gained a rich and varied IT, automation, machine learning, data analytics and statistics skillset and I now specialise in data science, analytical and automation artefacts both in data science or analyst and automation sectors.


I'm open to job opportunities, with my Curriculum Vitae available at [link](https://www.slideshare.net/PrashanthGuntal1/cv-163035030).
